<h1>Michigan Milk Producers Association, Canadian Dairy Distillery partner to upcycle dairy byproduct into biofuel</h1>



<h2><center>Partnership will build a low carbon ethanol plant in southwest Michigan to add needed biofuel supply and help lower the dairy industry’s carbon footprint.<center></h2>



<p><b>NOVI, Michigan – Michigan Milk Producers Association (MMPA) and Canadian Dairy Distillery</b> announced a joint initiative that will transform a dairy byproduct into the world’s lowest carbon-intensity ethanol, adding to the biofuel supply for cars and trucks.</p>



<p>Ontario-based Dairy Distillery developed technology to transform a lactose-rich dairy byproduct, called milk permeate into vodka, aptly named <b>Vodkow</b>. This high value use of milk permeate caught the attention of MMPA whose Constantine, MI facility produces 14,000 tonnes a year that’s being used for animal feed. Looking to create more value for its dairy farmer members, MMPA partnered with Dairy Distillery to build a plant to process its milk permeate into 2.2 million gallons of ethanol. When blended with transportation fuel, the permeate ethanol will offset 14,500 tonnes of carbon a year. This offset will reduce the carbon footprint of the milk processed at Constantine by 5%.</p>



<p>“I've been inspired by MMPA dairy farmers and their commitment to sustainability. Using a milk byproduct to reduce the carbon footprint of dairy is an innovation that will make a significant contribution to MMPA's net zero carbon emissions goal.” explains Dairy Distillery CEO <b>Omid McDonald</b>.</p>



<p>Ethanol production at the $40 million ethanol plant is planned for early 2025. The project received $2.5 million in funding from the Michigan Strategic Fund, showing the state’s commitment to the future of clean energy.</p>



<p>“Constructing an ethanol-processing plant at the Constantine facility compliments our focus on sustainability and provides a progressive, unique opportunity to utilize new technologies that add value to our current processing operations while further diversifying the markets we currently serve,” MMPA President and CEO <b>Joe Diglio</b> said. “It’s exciting to see innovative solutions such as this facility, which lead to growth and success for our members, employees, stakeholders and our communities.” </p>
